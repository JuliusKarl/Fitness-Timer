![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliusKarl/MyReactApp/master/public/31048.ico)

This application provides useful tools for athletes that want to train their reflexes, measure their stamina or live track their exercise routine:

Interval Beeper
 - This component will beep after every given interval and will remain that way until modified
 
Random Beeper
 - This component will bee at random times after a minimum wait time and before a maximum wait time. This component 
   supports reflex training.

Beep Test
 - This component is for those who want to measure their fitness and stamina accoridng to the beeper test used globally.
   Levels can be selected manually at the start of each level.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES
 - Works fine on Desktop, beep delay issues on mobile (iOS) Android untested.
 - Interval Beeper component completed.
 - Random Timer does not yet change times after each iteration. (maybe loop a setTimeout())
 - Beep Test unfinished. (need to import audio, create a <select> option for each level with links)
 - 
 - As of right now this is solely a desktop application until the above is complete.
